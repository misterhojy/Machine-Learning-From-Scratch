# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
made classifiers from scratch in python, Linear Classification, K-NN Classifier, Neural Network

You will implement several machine learning algorithms and evaluate their accuracy. This will be done for a downscaled version of the MNIST digit recognition dataset.

Like in real life, some of the tasks you will be asked to do may not be possible, at least directly. In these cases, your job is to figure out why it won't work and either propose a fix (best), or provide a clear explanation why it won't work.

For example, if the problem says to do k-nearest neighbors with a dataset of a billion points, this could require too much time to do each classification so it's infeasible to evaluate its test accuracy. In this case, you could suggest randomly downsample the data to a more manageable size, which will speed things up by may lose some accuracy. In your answer, then, you should describe the problem and how you solved it and the trade-offs.
